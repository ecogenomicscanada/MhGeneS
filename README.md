# MhGeneS

## Description

MhGeneS works in tandem with Seq2Sat to help validate microhaplotype genotyping of the coding region of genes. Within the MhGeneS pipeline the user can assess data quality in the form of sequencing error rates and read depth filter to increase the power and confidence in downstream genotype calling based on genic regions. MhGeneS can also be applied for genotype calling within non-coding regions.
